“We’ve collaborated … to bring the Tweed retail experience and product assortment to Regina,” said Evan, the store’s project manager. “They have a ton of experience and they’ve invested a ton of resources into making sure that they’re perfecting not only the product, but the retail experience.”

The store was busy Friday morning, bringing in about 100 people in the first hour of opening, according to Evan.

In an effort to support local business, the store brought in food and drink vendors for opening day, something they hope to do on a semi-regular basis moving forward.

Founded in Smiths Falls, Ont., Tweed currently has locations in Newfoundland and Labrador, Manitoba and British Columbia.

It is a subsidiary of Canopy Growth Corporation, a publicly-traded company based in Ontario that is listed on the Toronto and New York stock exchanges. Canopy Growth also owns an indoor growing facility in Yorkton called Tweed Grasslands.

Canopy Growth has an international reach. The corporation owns a medical cannabis subsidiary called Spectrum Cannabis that operates in Columbia, Germany, Czech Republic, Australia and Lesotho (a country in Southern Africa).

When asked if supply is expected to be an issue in their store like it has for others, Evan is optimistic they have things covered, at least for the near future.

“I think the fact that we’ve been dealing with them on a regular basis for several months now, we’ve been able to take some steps to work ahead and try to mitigate any issues with supply,” said Evan.

They don’t expect any supply issues over the holidays, but in an industry that’s new to most, he said that may be different a few months from now.

“It’s new for everybody on a producer level … and it’s working out the kinks and everyone’s learning, but it’s getting better as we go.”

Tweed is the third cannabis store to open in Regina since the drug became legalized across Canada on Oct. 17. The other stores are The Cannabis Co. YQR (1306 Broad St.) and Wiid Boutique (4554 Albert St.). [https://leaderpost.com/news/local-news/reginans-bundle-up-and-line-up-to-check-out-the-cannabis-co-yqr]
