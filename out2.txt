It is a subsidiary of Canopy Growth Corporation, a publicly-traded company based in Ontario that is listed on the Toronto and New York stock exchanges. Canopy Growth also owns an indoor growing facility in Yorkton called Tweed Grasslands. Canopy Growth has an international reach. The corporation owns a medical cannabis subsidiary called Spectrum Cannabis that operates in Columbia, Germany, Czech Republic, Australia and Lesotho (a country in Southern Africa).

They don’t expect any supply issues over the holidays, but in an industry that’s new to most, he said that may be different a few months from now. “It’s new for everybody on a producer level … and it’s working out the kinks and everyone’s learning, but it’s getting better as we go.” Tweed is the third cannabis store to open in Regina since the drug became legalized across Canada on Oct. 17.
